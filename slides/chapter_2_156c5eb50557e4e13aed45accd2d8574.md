## Building the binomial model

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "61470c0405"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Like most things in option pricing, the binomial model looks complex, but it's easier to understand it if we look at all its elements separately. The nodes are like bricks and we need something cohesive to keep them together. Because we are now dealing with a three-stage model, we'll need a bit more of it. Think of the state and risk-neutral prices and interest rates as concrete that keeps the bricks together. These things connect the nodes and make the model work as a single mechanism.

## Calculating interest rates

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "1c1c84e503"
```

`@script`
Why do we need to break the model into multiple stages when European options are only exercisable at expiration? That's because options are often used for hedging and it can be useful to know the value of your option portfolio at a given moment. It means that we have to break the interest rate into periodic interest rates. If we used the interest rate for the entire period for each stage, our calculations would be wrong. If we use all our concrete on just one layer of bricks, we won't be able to build much else. This is the formula we'll need to use - taking the cube root of the interest rate. The SQRT() function is useless, so we'll use the POWER() function instead. Taking the cube and quadratic roots is as simple as raising a number to the power of 3 or 4. You simply divide 1 by 3 or 4 to get the roots.

## Up or Down?

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "d5dbc31553"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
The state and risk-neutral moves will need to be applied at every stage. There are only two possibilities ahead of the option at each node. The price of the underlying can either rise or fall. Three blue lines means three Up moves, while three red lines leading to the bottom node in the final stage mean three Down moves. The trinomial model takes into account a scenario where the stock price holds steady. But this model is beyond the scope of this course.

## Working backwards

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "81eb57a920"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
An option does not have a future at its expiration date. That's why the state and risk-neutral values don’t matter at the final stage. You'll calculate the ending stock prices, use them to calculate ending option values. You'll work your way backwards to arrive at the present value. Doing things backwards works for languages like Hebrew and it often does in finance, too.

## Charting the way

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "d59c1d8b94"
```

`@script`
You know that derivatives derive their values from underlying assets. That's why we'll once again start with stock prices and gradually move on to actual option values. It follows that there will be four possible paths for the option instead of three in the previous exercise. But don't worry, once you learn the principle behind the model, it will be easy for you to expand it to as many periods as you like. In the following exercises, we'll also adjust the model to allow the used to customise it for different option types. By changing just one input, you will be able to instantly see the values of an option of the opposite type with the same characteristics. We'll again use the IF() function, but whole formulas will be used as arguments this time.

## On to the final stage!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "7c30577b2a"
```

`@script`
You’ve learned a lot of cool things you can do with spreadsheets and they will help you in this lesson. It's no time to rest on your laurels as you still have work to do. On to the final stage.
